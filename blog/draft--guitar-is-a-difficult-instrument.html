                <p>I've been playing the guitar very consistently for the last year or so. And although I have so much to learn, there are some things I can now see. There are some things I now understand. but now I can see a flaw that most of us, or at least most people I know (including me) fall into.</p>
    
                <p>I've given up on the Guitar many times. For as long as I can remember, I pick up the Guitar when I am hit with a sudden bout of inspiration, only to quickly put it back down a week or two later after some frustration. Usually it stays down for months, even years, before I pick it up again.</p>

                <p>There's just something so frustrating about hearing the buzzing of strings due to your inadequate skill. Knowing your fingers are weak - that they lack strength, dexterity, endurance, fludity. Slowly coming to the realization that the song you were so inspired to learn will require hours and hours and hours of training your hands.</p>

                And as I continue to explore the instrument, I'm only met with more complications. Take Music Theory for example. In order to make sense of what you're playing - such that it isn't mindless noodling, you need to have some idea of what you're doing. You need to have some idea of what notes you're hitting and why. And when you start learning your theory, it will be a confusing mess simply due to the Guitar's design 

                
                    
                    There's something so devastating in the realization that you won't be able to play your favorite songs like you imagined. I remember having dreams of playing Metallica solos to my friends As I continue to explore the instrument and learn more about making my own music, I've come to appreciate all those times I picked up the instrument even if for just a few minutes.</p>

                <p>I first picked up a guitar when I was in middle school, about 12 or 13 years old I think. I never took lessons, I never learned a full song, and I didn't play for much. I would get frustrated constantly, not having the dexterity or strength in my fingers to play some of my favorite songs.</p>
