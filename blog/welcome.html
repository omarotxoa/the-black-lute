                <p>Hello. The Black Lute is a project I’ve been wanting to start up for a while now. It's a project made to scratch an itch, as they say. This is my effort to create the website (and the music) I wish existed.</p> 
    
                <p>As much as I love Youtube and other media, I really do wish people spent more time making quality written content. I’m not talking about some clickbait blog post with the latest top X trendy-thing whose sole purpose is to funnel traffic to get you to buy some product they’re affiliated with. Not that I'm against people trying to make a buck, just that this tends to drive people into creating lackluster content full of intrusive ads and gated material. I'm thinking more about actual carefully thought out posts meant to inform, educate, or entertain. Maybe I’m just a dinosaur who grew up in a time when forums, blogs, messengers and websites (in other words: text) were the primary medium in which you learned and shared information.</p> 
    
                <p>I don’t think I can replicate the kinds of communities that were around back then - people with common interests who loved to teach and share without some self-advertising angle. That kind of purity to the internet has disappeared and I don’t know that it can be fostered again. What I can try to do though is share my genuine interest in the Guitar and my desire to create music in hopes of reaching like minded people. And as cliche as it sounds, if what I write and do on this website can resonate with even just one person, then I can call it a success.</p> 
    
                <p>If you’re reading this, you found yourself into my little corner of the web. Welcome. I hope you find what I do here helpful.</p>
