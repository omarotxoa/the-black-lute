                <p>Hello. The Black Lute is a project I’ve been wanting to start up for a while now. It's a project made to scratch an itch, as they say. This is my effort to create the website (and the music) I wish existed.</p> 
    
                <p>As much as I love Youtube and other media, I really do wish people spent more time making quality written content. There's just not enough of it out there for my liking. And most of it is plagued with the latest top-x trendy-style clickbaity posts - the sole purpose of it being to manipulate you into buying some service or product they're affiliated with. Not that I'm against people trying to make a buck, just that this tends to drive people into creating lackluster content full of intrusive ads, gated material and sales funnels.</p>

                <p>There are exceptions of course, and such exceptions are what inspire me to even try this. Although there is very little chance this will actual prove successful. Maybe I’m just a dinosaur who grew up in a time when forums, blogs, messengers and websites (in other words: text) were the primary medium in which you learned and shared information.</p> 
    
                <p>I don’t think I can replicate the kinds of communities that were around back then - people with common interests who loved to teach and share without some self-advertising angle. That kind of purity to the internet has disappeared and I don’t know that it can be fostered again.</p>
                    
                <p>All I can do is share my genuine interest in the Guitar and my desire to create music in hopes of reaching like minded people.</p> 
    
                <p>If you’re reading this, you found yourself into my little corner of the web. Welcome. I hope you find what I do here helpful.</p>
