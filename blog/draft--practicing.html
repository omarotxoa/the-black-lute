                <p>When I first started playing guitar, I was the type of player that collected a lot of bits of music. Intros to songs I knew, cool little solo's or licks, etc.</p>
                <p>Recently, I've been throwing that out and trying to approach the guitar as an instrument to make my own music, not just play someone else's stuff. I know that may seem obvious to some, but it never occured to me that I could create my own music.</p>
                <p>For whatever reason, I just had it in my head that I wasn't 'good enough' for that. Or that the guitar was just my hobby, and why even bother trying to make music if there was no possible way I had the dedication that other professionals did.</p>
                <p>Maybe its just the kind of thought process that pops up in kids. Maybe that's why you get so many little groups of kids - the rockers, the rappers, the ska rockabilly types, etc. Its a weird state of mind where there's only room for one type of music. I think whatever it is in our brains that does that also passes over to other things - jobs, careers, etc. You label yourself, and in doing so, you restrict yourself.</p> 
                <p>So now that I look back on it it kind of makes sense to me why I only focused on predominantly rock music and always someone elses stuff. I had mentally fucked myself into thinking I would never be able to create something good because I just didn't have the talent - so I restricted myself into playing other people's stuff.</p>
                <p>My dive into flamenco completely removed that odd mental barrier. I was initially attracted to flamenco because of its dissonant sounds and fast rasgueado/picado technique - it seemed to me that FLamenco was a kind of Metal on Acoustic.</p>
