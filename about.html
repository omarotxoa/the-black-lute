        <main>
            <p>The purpose of this page is to inform those who are curious. There are brief outlines of the content you will find on the webste, as well as other information one might be interested in.</p>
    
            <h2>General Introduction</h2>
            <p>The Black Lute is a website with the following purposes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>As an effort to provide written content in a world full of Video.</li>
                <li>As a place to explore and share the darker, sometimes dissonant (yet beautiful) shades of music: Flamenco, Mexican Folk, Darker Blues, and certain classical pieces among others.</li>
                <li>As a place to provide beginners with bits of music they can learn to supplement their learning.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>While there is much planned for this website - it is still under construction. At the moment, there is a Blog and minimal material. Here is a look at planned future content:</p>
    
            <h3>1. Flamenco Guitar Content</h3>
            <p>There are many websites that do an amazing job of teaching the different styles of Flamenco guitar. I happily link to those in the Resources page. Teaching the beginner from step step 0 is not the intention here.</p>
            <p>The Flamenco content you will find here is more a supplement to the general content you can find on Youtube and elsewhere. The content here will have an emphasis on variations of traditional/popular material. This includes variations of falsetas, phrases and embellishments. It will be a kind of catalog you can use to see the evolution of certain Flamenco Bits (falsetas,etc.) with the hope it will aid you as it does me in creating your own.</p>
    
            <h3>2. Dark Blues Content</h3>
            <p>Likewise, we don't plan on being yet another website to teach you how to play the Blues from step 0. There are many of these in existence and you will find links to our favorite in the Resources page.</p>
            <p>Instead, we plan on cataloging phrases, licks, turnarounds and studying the genre so we may improvise and have fun.</p>
    
            <h3>3. Practical Music Theory</h3>
            <p>We aim to have a section of the website dedicated to help the beginner learn the necessary information to improve their playing, improvising and composing.</p>
    
            <h3>4. The Blog</h3>
            <p>The Blog will explore many aspects of the Guitar, Composing, and the different darker folk music we're interested in.</p>
    
            <h2>Advertising</h2>
            <p>When browsing the web, we hate having newsletter sign ups pop up in our face. We hate having ads be intrusive - posted before, between, after and to the sides of content.</p> 
    
            <p>As of now there are no advertisements on the website.</p>
            
            <p>In the case that monetization becomes feasible, The Black Lute will strive for relevant advertisement tastefully included and non intrusive. We won't force a person to sign up for our newsletter or have obvious atrocious pages with big text and testimonials and large buttons that insult the viewers intelligence and whose sole purpose is to manipulate the user into buying something. We look at such actions as unethical and instead will rely on providing actual quality content that the user will be happy to purchase or support.</p>
