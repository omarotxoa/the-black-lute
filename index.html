            <p>The Black Lute is a project started up as a result of me trying to make my own music on the guitar. I like the darker, sometimes dissonant but melodic shades of music: mexican folk, flamenco, and darker blues. I post content here for my convenience and to share with those who are like minded. This isn't a how-to website, but you will find useful resources that have helped me develop into a musician that creates his own music in his own way.</p>
            <p>There's currently not a lot of content, but much is planned. You can start by reading the <a href="/about.html">About</a> page. This page will be updated with time as content is created.</p>
