        <h1>The Black Lute</h1>
        <p>This is a project started up as a result of me trying to make my own music on the guitar. I like the darker, sometimes dissonant but melodic shades of music: mexican folk, flamenco, and darker blues. I post content here for my convenience and to share with those who are like minded. This isn't a how-to website, but you will find useful resources that have helped me develop into a musician that creates his own music in his own way.</p>
