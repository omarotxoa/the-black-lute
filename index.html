            <p>Welcome to The Black Lute. A place for darker, sometimes dissonant but melodic shades of music: mexican folk, flamenco, and darker blues. I post content here for my convenience and to share with those who are like minded. This isn't a how-to website, but you will find writings of mine as I explore the different styles of acoustic guitar as well as useful resources that have helped me develop into a musician that creates his own music in his own way.</p>
            <p>The website is new, so its a bit barren around here, but much is planned. You can start by reading the <a href="/about.html">About</a> page. This page will be updated with time as content is created.</p>
