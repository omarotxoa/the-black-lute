        <h1>Feeling a bit overwhelmed</h1>
        <p><em>May 1, 2020</em></p>
        <p>There's quite a lot to learn and I've been having trouble getting started. I've already spent hours looking at different videos, articles and forum topics. I've bookmarked a bunch of websites, songs I will one day like to learn, and generally have spent a whole lot of time just not getting started (I even created this website for fucks sake). Sure, I dusted off my guitar and plucked away at the strings a bit playing whatever song has been recorded in my muscle memory from times past, but really, if I'm going to be honest, I've just been trying to ignore the enormity of the task I've set ahead of me. I guess there's a bit of fear in getting started so I've been procrastinating as much as possible.</p>
        <p>I've found a very helpful resource in the form of <a href="https://www.thisisclassicalguitar.com/free-classical-guitar-method-book-pdf/" target="_newtab">this free pdf</a>. Its got a little bit of everything: its tailored for beginners, it teaches you the basics of how to read standard notation and feeds you information little by little with exercises and short melodies you can play along the way. I've started to work through it and I've already found it to be incredibly helpful.</p>
        <p>The only problem I have with the pdf book linked above are the melodies and pieces provided are not really something my ear finds agreeable. So I've also chosen a simple piece to master that is more my taste:</p>
        <p><em><strong>Study in E Minor by Francisco Tarrega</strong></em>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xa6U8Z8yMyY" target="_newtab">Video</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://imslp.simssa.ca/files/imglnks/usimg/4/4d/IMSLP200459-PMLP340741-Tablature.pdf" target="_newtab">Tabs/Standard Notation</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>I'll still play the exercises and pieces provided by the book of course, but I also need something that I can have a genuine desire to play.</p>
        <p>I think this is good for now. I have the desire to start looking into a bunch of other things but really I should take it slow and just be consistent with practice rather than get distracted.</p>
