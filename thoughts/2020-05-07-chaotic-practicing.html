        <h1>Chaotic practicing</h1>
        <p><em>May 07, 2020</em></p>
        <p>So I've been playing a bit every day. Anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour or more.</p>
        <p>I've mostly been practicing the Study in E Minor by Tarrega and Villa-Lobos' Prelude No.4. I tend to just play those pieces over and over as its more fun than practicing from the classical guitar method ebook I mentioned in <a href="/thoughts/2020-05-01-overwhelmed.html">my previous post</a> for example.</p>
        <p>I do acknowledge that it is important to have focused practice of technique and such, but its such a daunting task for me at the moment that I'm just happy with consistently just picking up the guitar and playing.</p>
        <p>I plan to figure out a more rigorous and structured practice schedule later on, but for now I'm quite happy with just actually having got started.</p>
