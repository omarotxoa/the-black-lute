        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p><em>April 28, 2020</em></p>
        <p>The guitar is something I've picked up and toyed around with many times over the years. I haven't played it consistently since some 15 years ago when I was in High School. I don't know the notes on the fret board, I don't know any scales and if it wasn't for the fact that tuners show you the note of the string, I wouldn't know even that. Tablature made it so easy for me to learn whatever song I wanted to when I was a kid that I never bothered with Music Theory.</p>
        <p>I want to change that though. There are a few thoughts here. 
            <ol>
                <li>I regret not having properly learned the Guitar.</li>
                <li>I believe I can be really good at the guitar. I have some natural talent at it and I don't want to regret not giving it a serious go and seeing how great I can be.</li>
                <li>Music has been a big part of my life and I want to make my own.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>At 30 years old (31 next month), I feel time going by <em><strong>real fast</strong></em>. Its a bit scary. Then there's the Corona pandemic going on right now - and though I've always known life can end at any given time (car accident, etc), something about everyone being forced to quarantene and the uncertainty of it all has really got me thinking about doing something great before I can't.</p>
