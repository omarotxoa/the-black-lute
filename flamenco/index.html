            <p>Flamenco is a style of folk music popular in Spain. The Gypsies, or Gitanos, popularized it. It is played on an acoustic guitar and often accompanied by palmas, baile, or cante.</p>
            <h2>Flamenco Palos</h2>

            </p>
            <h2>General Structure</h2>
            <p>Flamenco is quite complex, there are many differences between Palos (styles), but generally speaking it can be said that most Flamenco Palos contain three parts: Compas, Falsetas, and Estribilla/marcajes/pasajes. .</p>
            <h3>Compás</h3>
            <p>Compás has many meanings. The way I think about Compás, speaking simply, is that which is the essence of the Palo (style of Flamenco). It is keeping time. It is The general feel. It is the heart of the palo. It is what you will hear repeatedly and how you will distinguish one form of Flamenco from another.</p>
            <p>Compás is the easiest (technically speaking) part of a Palo to play, but very important (and can be quite difficult) to play correctly in terms of time/feel.</p>
            <p>For beginners, it helps to think of Compas as that which you play while the Cantador sings.</p>
            <p><em>"...it is [compás] probably the most important thing you will do in Flamenco. In fact, if you play good Compás, you'll get some respect as a Flamenco Player. If you play great falsetas and crazy fast scales but your compás isn't good, you won't - it's really hard to get an 'ole'"</em> - Kai Norezo.</p>
            <h3>Estribilla / Marcajes </h3>
            <p>Estribilla / Marcajes are a type of Compas with a heavier pulse and strength.</p>
            <p>If Compas is what you play while the cantador sings, an Estribilla or Marcaje is what you play when a Bailador dances.</p>
            <h3>Falsetas</h3>
            <p>The Falseta is what most people in other styles of music think of as a Solo or Lick. Its the Guitarists moment to make the Guitar sing.</p>
