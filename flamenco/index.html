            <p>Flamenco is a style of folk music popular in Spain. The Gypsies, or Gitanos, popularized it. It is played on an acoustic guitar and often accompanied by palmas, baile, or cante.</p>
            <h2>General Structure</h2>
            <p>Before we move on to more in depth discussion and examples of the various parts of a Soleá, lets briefly talk about them here.</p>
            <h3>Compás</h3>
            <p>Compás has many meanings. The way I think about Compás, speaking simply, is that which is the essence of the Palo (style of Flamenco). It is keeping time. It is The general feel. It is the heart of the palo. It is what you will hear repeatedly and how you will distinguish one form of Flamenco from another.</p>
            <p>Compás is the easiest (technically speaking) part of a Palo to play, but very important (and can be quite difficult) to play correctly in terms of time/feel.</p>
            <p><em>"...it is [compás] probably the most important thing you will do in Flamenco. In fact, if you play good Compás, you'll get some respect as a Flamenco Player. If you play great falsetas and crazy fast scales but your compás isn't good, you won't - it's really hard to get an 'ole'"</em> - Kai Norezo.</p>
