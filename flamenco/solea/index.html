            <p>Soleá comes from the spanish word "Soledad" which means "Solitude."  It is said that the Soleá is the mother of all palos. Although it is not the oldest palo, it is held by Flamenco players as one of the most important and fundamental to learn. It is a style of flamenco with 12 beats. Here is the traditional Solea as I learned it, adapted for beginners:</p>

            <p>I say adapted for beginners, because you won't find simple Soleá's like this in recorded materials and the tempo is really slow for a Solea. Most soleá recordings you can hear online (spotify and the like) will have very fast, very complex arpeggios and falsetas as well as fast rasgueados and other tecniques that the beginner cannot execute without rigorous practice. Even something as simple as staying in rythm with the 12-beat compas at its usual 90bpm is difficult for the beginner (hence why I played at my own pace in the video).</p>
            <h2>Listening Material</h2>
            <p>Here is a list of traditional Soleá you can listen to. These are Solea whose sections are more obviously marked, making them better candidates for study to the beginner than any modern solea:</p>

            <!-- <p>Here is a list of Soleá with a traditional base but with modern elements. This is great to listen to when you've studied the traditional material and are looking to start giving your own Solea a more modern flavor:</p>

            <p>Modern Soleá is a lot more complex and takes years of practice and experience to play/create. It is sometimes hard to even hear that they are Solea. These are examples for the curious and advanced:</p>
