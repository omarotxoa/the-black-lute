        </header>
        <main>
            <p>Soleá comes from the spanish word "Soledad" which means "Solitude."  It is said that the Soleá is the mother of all palos. Although it is not the oldest palo, it is held by Flamenco players as one of the most important and fundamental to learn. It is a style of flamenco with 12 beats. Here is the traditional Solea as I learned it, adapted for beginners:</p>
            <p>I say adapted for beginners, because you won't find simple Soleá's like this in recorded materials. Most soleá recordings you can hear online (spotify and the like) will have very fast, very complex arpeggios and falsetas as well as fast rasgueados and other tecniques that the beginner cannot execute without rigorous practice.</p>
            <h2>Listening Material</h2>
            <p>Here is a list of traditional Soleá you can listen to. These are Solea whose sections are more obviously marked, making them better candidates for study to the beginner than any modern solea:</p>

            <p>Here is a list of Soleá with a traditional base but with modern elements. This is great to listen to when you've studied the traditional material and are looking to start giving your own Solea a more modern flavor:</p>

            <p>Modern Soleá is a lot more complex and takes years of practice and experience to play/create. It is sometimes hard to even hear that they are Solea. These are examples for the curious and advanced:</p>

            <h2>General Structure of the Soleá</h2>
            <p>Before we move on to more in depth discussion and examples of the various parts of a Soleá, lets briefly talk about them here.</p>
            <h3>Compás</h3>
            <p>Compás has many meanings. The way I think about Compás, speaking simply, is that which is the essence of the Palo (style of Flamenco). It is keeping time. It is The general feel. It is the heart of the palo. It is what you will hear repeatedly and how you will distinguish one form of Flamenco from another.</p>
            <p>Compás is the easiest (technically speaking) part of a Palo to play, but very important (and can be quite difficult) to play correctly in terms of time/feel.</p>
            <p><em>"...it is [compás] probably the most important thing you will do in Flamenco. In fact, if you play good Compás, you'll get some respect as a Flamenco Player. If you play great falsetas and crazy fast scales but your compás isn't good, you won't - it's really hard to get an 'ole'"</em> - Kai Norezo.</p>
