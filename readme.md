# The Black Lute
The Black Lute is a website I'm making to help organize and facilitate my learning. While it is primarily for myself, I will be designing and posting content in such a way that it'd be useful to other people as well. In this sense, the Black Lute is a website dedicated to providing resources for those interested in learning Flamenco and Darker shades of music.

## The Future
- I eventually want it to be a very slick and easy to navigate website. Where you can quickly access specific pieces of information for reference, practice and learning. 
- I would like to create an app for compas in the future. Something simple that just helps new people keep time with the 12-beat structure.

## Content
The content will be written and shown in Diagrams or PDFs (Sheet Music). Simplicity is key here. Any explanations that go along with some things will be more akin to notes than description.
