# The Black Lute
The Black Lute  is a project started up as a result of me trying to make my own music on the guitar. I like the darker, sometimes dissonant but melodic shades of music: mexican folk, flamenco, darker blues, etc. I post content here for my convenience and to share with those who are like minded. This isn't a how-to website, but part of its intent is to help organize and facilitate my learning, and so you might also find useful resources that have helped me develop into a musician that creates his own music in his own way. I think I'm also coming to the realization that I'm a bit obsessed with Flamenco and I have the urge to collect and record a lot of Flamenco bits and pieces (falsetas, phrases, embellishments, etc).
